## Tech Stack 

Built with:


* Python
* Django 
* Create React
* JavaScript 
* Bulma 
* SCSS 
* Express 
* PostgreSQL


## Release History

* I will be spending my time updating this app. I want to show the challenges that I came across building it in the timeframe given and to also show what I've accomplished outside the classroom. I also really love the concept and think it's very needed in these times. 


## Deployment

This game is deployed via Heroku and can be found here - [Dear Love Letters](https://dear-love-letters.herokuapp.com/)





# How To Start 

You can fork and clone this app! Once forked/cloned to your repository, open the index.html file in the browser and the app loads. Feel free to replace images and customise to your liking. 

# Built Game 
This app was created with multiple SQL relationships models between the penpal, feelings, and herbs that linked to the feeling. My focus was more so on the front-end so I used Bulma and Sass to make the app look aesthetically pleasing.

The user would start at the home page and type in an emotion they are feeling. It will then generate all the letters that with that evoked emotion for the user to pick from. The object of the app is to connect like minded individuals from anywhere in the world.

To navigate the app you must register first. It is a members based app due to the privacy of the members. Once you have registered with your name, location, and email, then the user can start writing feeling based letters.

# Approach 
## Planning 

* My projects as you can see are very influenced by my every day life. When the instructor informed us about project four, I had a few ideas up my sleeve prior, but this one was the most unique. I thought it was a nice way for me to prove my skills and show my progression in using relationships of models. It took me two days to plan and one day to wireframe my ideas into pages. 




# Challenges and Improvements
## Challenges:


* My biggest challange was making sure my app was functional. Getting the many to many realtionships  make sense took about four days. The way I wire-framed.

# Improvements 

I plan to advance and improve this app. By adding a map to it for the user can locate other memebers and penapals from across the world. I want to add a mailbox so the member can find their letters seamlessly. I want to add a pop quiz that helps the member with their feelings and finding herbs to match. 

# Key Learning 

* Sass 
* Python 
* MongoDB
