    "love_letter": "Hello beautiful being,  WOAH look at you. You are here. Doing it. Living it. Relishing in all that you knew yourself to be. You\u2019ve overcome so many of your own internal obstacles, got out of your own way, and rose from ashes of all the stories you collected from others in the past. Vibrant... that\u2019s you. Effortless present, purposefully driven, graciously growing \u2014 I see the light in you. Notice how your old highs are your new lows, your old worries you understand so clearly that they humor you. I mean...... this is it, this is life. And you are living it. You are a vision of abundance, a vessel of love, pure trust of self, eternal compassion for others. I am in awe of you.  Thank you for existing, thank you being, thank you for YOU.  Love you infinitely Heart suit",

    "love_letter": "I'm so happy i put some time aside to write you. I feel like it's been forever since I've updated you on things. It's almost a whole March out here, we made it praise God. So much has been happening and the truth is, I'm tired. BUT it's what I prayed for and God been working. Remember the Vision Board Party i wanted to do for HNOW? Freaked it. Im really happy about that, thank you for your encouraging words. Now i'm just trying to work on managing my time. The nerve of me to think I'd be able to \"lay low\" before the summer. Chile, this city dead never sleeps but praise God for opportunity and ability. ANYWAYS what about YOU? I'm so excited to hear about how 2020 has been for you. I know you're out there killing it! You have to update me on that thing* (wink, wink). I miss you, but cest la",

But you know what I'm happy I did it.",
